## Creating a React App from Scratch

**I will be going over how to create a web application without using create-react-app. I am learning this from the youtube video found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=deyxI-6C2u4). Another potential learning source is [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zb2mQyQRwqc)**

**As I learn more about the dependencies I will add what they do**

### Dependencies
- [x] React: a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [x] React-Dom: React package for working with the DOM.

### Dev Dependencies
- [x] Webpack: Bundles your assets together.
- [x] Webpack Dev Server: allows us to spin up a hot reloading web server.
- [x] Webpack CLI: Allows us to use Webpack commands from the command line.
- [x] Babel-core: This is the main Babel transpiller.
- [x] Html Webpack Plugin: Simplifies creation of HTML files to serve your webpack bundles.

#### Notes
- The .babelrc file lets babel know what presets that it needs to work with. This is important for creating code that works everywhere.
